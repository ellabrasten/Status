Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I have researched a proper way to go about the project, inspiration, and I have started writing the code for my game. I have started to write python to insert images, colors, line width, and more. 

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I need to finish the code and make sure it runs properly. I may also add small details to the game, like changes in color, background, etc. 

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

Just writing the code from scrath is a little difficult since I had to come up with the exact procedure and layout of the game.
